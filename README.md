# Open Innovators Fellowship

A collaborative program empowering creative individuals to contribute to open-source projects that promote autonomy and individual freedom through mentorship, skill-building, and a welcoming atmosphere.

## Mission

Our mission is to cultivate a global community of innovative individuals dedicated to developing open-source projects that empower people with financial autonomy, privacy, and self-sovereignty. Through mentorship, skill development, and the creation of a supportive atmosphere, we aim to foster collaboration and inspire meaningful contributions to the open-source ecosystem.
